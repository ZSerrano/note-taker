## Description
Created a semi-functioning Note Taker app that is meant to allow the user to write a note and save it for later.  The saved notes are compiled onto a db.json folder and can be read by utilizing a route to search it. My program was not allowing headers to be sent from the my fetch calls for an unknown reason, and therefore couldn't be deployed to Heroku successfully.  I resorted to creating a deployed link from Github Pages instead.
